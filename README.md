# Blockchain Technologies Assignment: Implementing a Basic Blockchain with Merkle Tree
**Team members:** Zhandos Seitkaliyev, Aibar Spatayev <br>
**Group: IT-2103**
## Investigate Blockchain Principles ##
**Main blockchain principles:**      
>Decentralization 
>>Security
>>>Consensus Mechanism
>>>>Immutability
>>>>>Transparency
>>>>>>Privacy

**Working mechanisms of blockchain:**
* Decentralization
* Cryptographic Hash Functions
* Transaction Validation
* Peer-to-Peer Network
* Smart Contracts

## Define Blockchain Structure ##
* **Blocks** - blockchain is a complex of blocks, all of which contain data.
* **Header** - header is located in every block and contains metadata information about block. Metadata includes reference to the previous block's hash and self-unique hash.
* **Chain of Blocks** - all blocks are linked to each other through hash so it makes structure from resistant to tampering.
* **Decentralized Network** - information on every blockchain is not stored in main server. Every blockchain is stored inside of PC around the world.
* Also blockchain has: 
  * **Genesis code**
  * **Consensus Mechanism**
  * **Transactions**
  * **Immutability**
  * **Network Protocol**
